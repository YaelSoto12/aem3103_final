  # Paper Airplane Numerical Study
  Final Project: AEM 3103 Spring 2024

  - By: Yael Soto-Adolfo

  ## Summary of Findings
  Table:

  This study analysis the changes of the height and range depending on the changes in velocity and flight path angle.
  An increase in velocity and flight path angle will increase the height and range. The plane will want to peak in height      between 0 to 5 meters in range. 
 
  # Code Listing
  A list of each function/script and a single-line description of what it does. The name of the function/script should link to the file in the repository on GitHub.

  # Figures

  ## Fig. 1: Single Parameter Variation

  <2D trajectory simulated by varying single parameter at at time>
  <The above plot should also show the nominal trajectory>

  The top graph is being changing with repect to velocity and the bottom graph is being changed with respect to path angle.
  The velocity of the plane has a greater impact on height than the flight path angle, the ranges are almost the same.

  ## Fig. 2: Monte Carlo Simulation
  <2D trajectories simulated using random sampling of parameters, overlay polynomial fit onto plot.>

  The 100 runs show a consistant trend of having a max height between 0 to 5 meters of range and the polynomial showing the
  the average trajectory ofthe 100 runs.

 ## Fig. 3: Time Derivatives
 <Time-derivative of height and range for the fitted trajectory>

 The rate of climb speed decrases with time, but the velocity of the plane increases after around one second.
